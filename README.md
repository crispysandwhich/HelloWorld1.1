# NO Name

I am going to be going at this towards a different direction from before. I feel like everything is kinda of all over the place not only with the project but honestly just everywhere. I am going to try and structure this a little bit better but also end up doing a few things different. For the momment this is what is going to happen: 

- [ ] finish the Style and responsive part
- [ ] configure a db for certain material and launch it as an API.
- [ ] create a few smart contracts and link it together with app 
- [ ] connect to nervos network 

- [ ] Future implementation for either app or program or both.


The project may remain the same but looking at a major update to just make things a little more..... smother. Just need to wire this up effeciently. :(
